	/*=====================
	 *   So this is odd putting it here, but I think it belongs here.
	 *   This script moves the foot clockwise and counterclockwise based on its location relative to the hip when the foot is protracted
	 *   It does this by adding a force continually at the correct angle on the foot
	 * 
	 *   I believe that when the foot is on the ground or stuck, this force should also be added to the body in the opposite way
	 *   I don't know where else to put that force so it's going in here
	 * 
	 *   NOTE:  I'm not sure how to yet add the force less if the foot is moving or pushing, but I'll think about it
	 *          So, currently, if the foot is touching anything, it will add the force to the body as well
